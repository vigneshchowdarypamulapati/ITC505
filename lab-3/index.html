    <h1>LAB-3 Assignment: Serving Fonts</h1>
    <p>
        When it comes to serving fonts, I preferred using Google Fonts for this assignment 
        because it well endowed with fonts and easy to implement.
        Go to the google fonts website then choose your intended font click on the font and 
        clipboard the link tag that follows it and then paste it in the head section of your html file. 
        Once done you can actually refer the fonts right into your CSS file in the hope 
        that it has the capability to work.
        Although the fonts that are mapped to your system are allowed, it is discouraged to use them 
        because some other device may not recognize them. To avoid this confusion interfering 
        throughout different platforms, It is more helpful to stick to services such as Google 
        Fonts or similar font-hosting services.
        The fonts that I chose are Courier New, Dancing Sript. 
        For h1 tag, I used Courier New; for the paragraph tag, Dancing Script. 
        I also used other stylings for each tag like, to highlight font size and font weight of each font 
        in my document. Moreover, I used JavaScript to make the date last 
        modified on the document appear also on the page.

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: 
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
    </footer>
