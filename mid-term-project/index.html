        <h2>Addendum: Process, Creative Choices, and Challenges</h2>
        <p>In this project, I focused on creating an engaging, user-friendly webpage with a warm, earthy color palette and a responsive layout. My creative choices included using rich browns and accent gold to evoke a cozy atmosphere and pairing 'Cinzel' and 'Lora' fonts for a blend of elegance and readability. I employed Flexbox to ensure the page would be responsive and well-aligned on various screen sizes, particularly focusing on ensuring buttons aligned side by side on larger screens and stacked vertically on smaller devices. One major challenge was ensuring the buttons adjusted correctly across devices, which I overcame using Flexbox and media queries. Additionally, I fine-tuned the hover effects on the buttons to create a dynamic but subtle interaction. Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into the importance of responsive design and typography, learning how small adjustments in layout and design can significantly enhance user experience. After deploying the page, I tested it on multiple devices to verify that all elements, including buttons and images, functioned as expected. This project provided me with a deeper understanding of how to balance aesthetics and functionality while improving my web design and development skills.</p>
