        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>One ofthe most difficultissues inmedicine is predicting heartillness. Heart disease is becomingincreasingly
            common, and being able to predict such diseases in advance is critical. This is a challenging diagnosis that
            needs to be made correctly and swiftly. In this paper, we propose AutoML frameworks for predicting
            heart diseases, such as AutoGluon and H20. The dataset contains 919rows and12 columns withattributes
            such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, RestingBP,Cholestrol, FastingBS, RestingECG, MaxHR, ExerciseAngina,
            Oldpeak, STSlope. While training the data AutoGluon uses LightGBM, RandomForset, and
            WeightedEnsemble provide certain accuracy and H20 uses XGBoost, GBM, and StackedEnsemble to
            provide certain accuracy among them H20 provides better results.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Heart illness has gotten a lot of attention in
            medical research among the numerous lifethreatening disorders. Heart disease diagnosis is
            difficult, but it can automatically predict the
            patient's heart status,resulting in more successful
            therapy. The indications and symptoms of the
            patient, as well as a physical examination, are
            widely utilized to identify cardiac disease.
            Tobacco use, high blood cholesterol, a family
            history of cardiovascular disease, obesity, high
            blood pressure, and physical inactivity are all risk
            factors for heart disease. Providing high-quality services at reasonable prices is an important
            issuefor medical institutions such as hospitals
            and clinics. Properly diagnosing patients and
            providing
            appropriate treatment is an example of quality
            service. The public database on heart disease
            includes both numerical and category data. These
            records are cleaned and filtered before further
            processing to remove extraneous data from the
            database. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the
            largest cause of deathworldwide, accounting for
            an estimated 17.9 million deaths per year,
            according to the World Health Organization.</p>    
        <p>You can save lives by identifying the people
            who are most vulnerable to cardiovascular
            disease and getting the right treatment. It is
            important to identify the cardiovascular disease
            as soon as possible so that treatment can begin
            with counseling and medication. For this project,
            I used AutoML like Auto Gluon and H20. The
            framework makes it very convenient and
            improves the efficiency of the model. Automated
            machine learning refers tothe process of applying
            a machine learning (ML) model to a realproblem
            through automation (AutoML). In particular, it
            automates machine learning model selection,
            assembly, and parameterization. Automated
            machine learning processes are easier to use than
            hand- coded algorithms and often give faster and
            more accurate results. The AutoML software
            platformmakesmachine learning more accessible
            to companies that do not have a dedicated data
            scientist or machine learning expert. AutoML is
            important because it detects watershed periods
            in artificial intelligence andmachine learning. AI
            and machine learning have been called "black
            boxes." To summarise, reverse engineering
            machine learning algorithms is difficult.They
            increase the efficiency and processing power
            required to produce results, but it can be difficult
            to grasp how the algorithm generated those
            findings.As a result, if the model is a black box,
            predicting the outcome can be challenging,
            making it more difficult to select the best model
            for a given situation. AutoML helps to liberate
            machine learning fromthe black box by making it
            more approachable. Those who undertake this
            duty must comprehend the algorithm's internal
            logic and how it connects to the actual scenario.</p>    
        <h2>Related Work</h2>  
        <p>In [1] Heart Disease prediction is a difficult task
            in clinical data analysis. Neural networks and
            Machine learning appear to be more favorable in
            benefitting decision-making and predicting from
            largeamounts of healthcare data. We noticed that
            various features had been used in the latest
            machine learning model developments. In thiswork, they have proposed ML techniques for
            predicting cardiorespiratory disease using
            features. In terms of accuracy, the decision tree
            classifier outperformed the others. We used
            various algorithms, including Neural Networks,
            KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, DT
            Classifier, and XGB classifier, to determine which
            technique predicts cardiovascular disease more
            accurately.</p>  
        <p>In [2] Fatma Zahra Abdeldjouad and colleagues
            proposed a new hybrid model for predicting
            heart disease. Adaptive Boosting, Logistic
            Regression, Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction,
            Genetic Fuzzy System-LogitBoost, Multiobjective
            Evolutionary Fuzzy Classifier, and Fuzzy Hybrid
            Genetic Based Machine Learning were among the
            techniques employed.</p>   
        <p>In [3] Pattern prediction for disease prevention
            and management is a very hard and important
            requirement in the medical area. They proposed
            an ML scheme for predicting the likelihood of
            heart disease using the different types of
            algorithms inthis article. Fivealgorithms areused
            in this framework: Random Forest, Hoeffding
            Decision Tree, Nave Bayes, SVM, and Logistic
            Model Tree. The first step is to transform the textbased data into a visual format using a variety of
            data visualization techniques to identify
            previously unknown trends. The next step is to
            use feature selection to reduce verbose and
            insignificant data. This will greatly improve the
            prediction rate. The third step is to train the
            model anduse classification techniques to make
            predictions for the test dataset. The last step is to
            suggest ways toincrease the predictive value of
            the method.</p>   
        <p>In [4] P. Ramprakash et al. created and proposed
            a framework and model built with a deep neural
            network and an x^2-statistical model. They
            discovered the principles of predicting patients'
            risk profilesusing clinical data parameters during
            this investigation. They have also eliminated the
            problem of fittingand over-fitting data and for the
            efficiency of the data they have used ANN and
            DNN algorithms and for accurately predicting
            heart disease.</p>  
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <img src="figure1.jpg">
        <p>To forecast heart illness, the proposed study
            analyses categorization methods and conducts an
            overall performance analysis. The primary
            purpose of the investigation is to determine
            whether or not a patienthas a heart illness. We
            looked for any null values and duplicate values
            are present in the dataset. To know the in-depth
            analysis of the dataset, we visualize the dataset to
            know how the different attributesare related to
            the target variable. Different statistics such as
            mean, std, min, and max are visualized andplot
            graph with the among attributes also with the
            target attribute (heart disease). The idea is to
            utilize AutoML frameworks such as Auto Gluon
            and H20 and then analyze both frameworks and
            utilize the best algorithm among them. This
            health information was provided by a
            professional who received it from the medical
            records of their patients. The use of different
            AutoML frameworks provides a more
            comprehensive understanding of how AutoML
            works. The data is fed into two different
            frameworks such as Auto Gluon and H20. Auto
            Gluon uses different algorithms such as
            LightGBM, Weighted Ensemble, Random Forest
            and H20 uses models, Stacked Ensemble,
            XGBoost, and GBM. After the successful training
            of the models, an analysis was done on both the
            frameworks among them Stacked Ensemble
            provides better accuracy.</p>

        <p>Figure2 shows aUML diagram. Use casediagrams
            to illustrate the high-level features and scope of
            the system. These figures also show how the
            system and its various actors interact. The use
            cases and actors in the Use Case Diagram
            illustrate the system's characteristics and how
            the actors interact with it, but not how the system
            works within.</p>    
        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <p>In XGBoost, gradient-boosted decision trees are
            implemented. The XGBoost model dominates
            several Kaggle competitions. In this process, the
            decision trees were created in sequence. Weights
            are very important in XGBoost. All independent
            elements are weighted and entered into the
            decision tree that predicts the outcome. Variable
            weights are incorrectly predicted as the tree
            grows and these variables are passed. These
            variables are passed to the second decision tree.
            The results of many of these
            classifiers/predictors are then integrated to
            produce a more powerful and accurate model. It
            can be used to tackle classification, ranking,
            regression, and custom prediction issues.
            Light GBM boosting framework is based upon
            decision trees which boosts the efficiency of the
            model while using less memory. It uses two novel
            methods; one is Exclusive Feature Bundling
            secondis Gradient-based One Side Sampling to
            address the shortcomings of typical GBDT
            frameworks' histogram-based approach. GOSS
            and EFB are the two methods that are described
            here, which comprise LightGBM Algorithms
            features. They collaborate to ensure that the
            model runs smoothly and gives it an edge over a
            competing framework of GBM.</p>   
        <p>In ensembled approaches of machine learning,
            many algorithms for learning are utilized to offer
            thebest-anticipated performance other than any
            of the individual learning algorithms. Ensembles
            are usedin several of today's most prominent
            machine learning methods. Gradient Boosting
            Machine and RandomForest are two examples of
            ensemble learners. Bagging (for an instance,
            Random Forest) and boosting (for example,
            Gradient boosting Machine) were ensembling
            procedures that take a set of feeblelearners (for
            example, decision tree) and combine them into a
            single, powerful learner. H2O's Ensemblemethod
            was a supervised ensemble ML algorithm that
            stacks several prediction algorithms to discover
            the most effective combination. Every supervised
            model presents H2O, including Stacked
            Ensemble, support regression, and multiclass
            classification binary classification.
            </p>     
        <p>Each ensemble member's contribution to a
            forecast can be weighted based on their trust or
            performance on a holdout dataset with weighted
            average ensembles. Model averaging is a
            technique forensemble learning in which each
            member of the ensemble makes an identical
            contribution for prediction. In a weighted
            ensemble, which is a continuation of the
            averaging of the model ensemble, each member's
            contribution to the final forecast is weighted
            according to the model's performance. The
            weights in the taken model are very small positive
            integer numbers, and the total of every weight
            equals one, indicating the degree.</p>    
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>By using these AutoML frameworks like
            AutoGluon and H20, we obtained accuracies of
            different algorithms and we took the highest
            accuracy giving algorithm as our final prediction.
            The Prediction using AutoGluon was shown in
            Table 1.</p>

            random row number of the dataset obtained in
            the final prediction. Whereas“0” represents the
            chance of not getting heart disease and “1”
            represents the chance of getting heart disease.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>    
        <p>In this study, we developed a heart disease
            prediction model that analyses a patient's
            medical history topredict whether or not they
            would develop heart disease. We have done this
            work using three modulesthe first one being the
            data preprocessing method, the second one is
            building the model using the AutoGluon/H20
            framework and the last one is updating and
            predicting</p>    
        <p>The AutoGluon framework uses 3 algorithms,
            they are LightGBM, Weighted Ensemble, and
            Random Forest which helped us to obtain an
            accuracy of 89.5 percent. While in the H2O
            framework there are three algorithms, they are
            Stacked Ensemble, XGBoost, and GBM, and using
            the H20 Framework, wewere able to obtain the highest level of accuracy, 93.7 percent.</p> 
        <p>In the future, we would like to consolidate
            various datasets to get more views, select the
            appropriate attributes to improve performance
            and run additional tests.</p>
