        <h2>Development Process and Reflections</h2>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>The first step of the development process involved finding out more about the basic dynamics of the Lights Out game. 
            I identified the key actions: switching a cell and it is neighbors, shuffling of all the cells in the board while 
            making it solvable, and the win condition. Structuring the 5x5 board 
            made the game scalable and was easy to manipulate programmatically using Java Script. 
            of the grid. For operation of the cells, I designed the <code>toggleLights</code> function that controls cell. 
            states shift and used the <code>randomizeBoard</code> function to emulate 
            random clicks for solvable starting states, Last of all, I included the <code>checkWin</code> 
            a victory function to accompany the gameplay, as well as a moves counter to keep score.</p>
        <h3>Creative Choices</h3>
        <p>In the creation of the grid, I chose to use flexible loops, for there is future development, 
            for instance changing the size of the grid from the one I was using. As such, to ensure that 
            the Sudoku board is solvable at all times, I opted to perform random clicks by selecting arbitrary 
            cell positions on an initially solved board rather than random individual cells. Another 
            advantage derived from that was the improvement in reliability of gameplay. About the new 
            features: This is why a move counter was put in place; it provides those who are taking their 
            time to strategies an idea of how far the game has advanced.</p>
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
        <p>Several challenges arose during development. Handling edge cases for the toggle logic was 
            tricky since clicking a cell at the edge or corner of the grid could lead to errors. 
            This was resolved by adding boundary checks for valid indices. Ensuring solvable boards 
            proved complex; randomizing individual cells often created unsolvable puzzles, so I used 
            simulated clicks on an initially solved state instead. Resetting the move counter on new 
            games was another issue, which I addressed by reinitializing the counter during board setup. 
            Visual clarity also required attention, and I used distinct colors and responsive design for 
            clear user feedback.</p>
        <h3>Insights Gained</h3>
        <p>This project reinforced the importance of modular code design, as splitting logic into smaller 
            functions like <code>toggleLights</code>, <code>checkWin</code>, and <code>randomizeBoard</code> 
            simplified debugging and made the code easier to extend. I learned that thoughtful user 
            feedback—like the move counter and "YOU WIN!" message—greatly enhances player engagement. 
            Thorough testing of edge cases ensured a smooth experience, teaching me the value of early 
            error detection. Lastly, designing for scalability allowed me to create a game that could 
            easily adapt to new rules or configurations, demonstrating the importance of forward-thinking 
            development practices.</p>
